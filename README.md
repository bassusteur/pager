This project is what i think an ideal portable pager would be like, powered by a risc-v core inside the ESP32-C6 on-board, it features a pretty standard interface for a pager: except for the 
exceptionally larger LCD, it has 4 buttons for selecting and writing text.  
Communication is made possible through various methods such as zigbee or wifi, the neat part is the Serial port which could allow for fun tinkering with computers and embedded devices.
Portability wise i have added an 18650 battery pack and all the circuitry necessary to make this an off-grid device.
